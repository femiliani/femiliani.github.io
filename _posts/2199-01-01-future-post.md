On the second installment of #CloningForAll we look at Golden Gate. Have you ever thought "wow restriction cloning is so easy but having restriction sites between my fragments is ugly"? Read on for the best of both worlds. 


What is Golden Gate?
======
GG is restricton cloning with a fancier class of restriction enzymes (RE). What's the difference? The REs you are likely familiar with cut within their recognition site. This means that everytime EcoRI cuts it produces the same overhangs. GG is performed with TypeIIs REs. They are unique because they cut AWAY from their recognition site. They don't care what the sequence they cut is. And therefore we can make it whatever we need. 

Why Golden Gate?
======
When to use GG? Like Gibson it can handle many fragment assemblies (30++), but it isn't dependent on exposing homologous DNA and so it will work when the fragments share similarities. Eg for inserting two U6 promoters in a plasmid use GG.
