I was fortunate to learn cloning techniques from some excellent teachers (who sadly, when I asked for permission to name them, asked to remain anynonymous). Since then I've been challenged by progressively more complex plasmids and have learned (the hard way) some tips and tricks that assure cloning success. I don't pretend to claim that I am the best, just that I've learned simple things that can help everyone. And here I will try to share them with you so that you will come to love cloning too.
