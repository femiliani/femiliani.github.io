In the first #CloningForEveryone session we will look at Gibson Assembly, which in my opinion is the most worthwhile to learn because it will let you clone almost anything. And once you know the secret to it, it's as easy as restriction cloning.


How does Gibson assembly work?

The goal of these posts are not to bog you down in detail, but I think it is helpful to understand the principle of Gibson assembly. 


You can have many headings

Contains a lot of useful comments from people who share their knowledge and also on cheaper alternatives to Gibson. Keep in mind that the NEB HiFi kit contains more than an exonuclease so while these alternative reagents work for generic Gibson they might not work for all applications that NEB lists their HiFi kit can be used for. 

What reagents do I use?

I am not sponsored by any of these companies. I just can confidently say their products work. 
NEB HiFi master mix - Cat# E2621
NEB Q5 2x master mix -  Cat# M0494
Thermo Fisher SybrGreen - Cat# S7563
