Francesco is still trying to learn how to set up his personal page so please ignore most of what is on here. My priority will be to try to set up the blogs for cloning tutorials and tips. Hope you'll find your way back here once I figure out what I want it to look like! 

Lessons in MolBio
======
I was fortunate to learn cloning techniques from some excellent teachers. They laid the foundation which I then built-on by creating (unnecessarily) complex plasmids. What I've learned is that cloning is actually easy once you know the rules that are written between the lines of protocols. In the [Lessons in MolBio](https://femiliani.github.io/year-archive/) I will try to share the tips/tricks/rules I learnt with you so that you will come to love cloning too.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons. 

Example: editing a markdown file for a talk

More info about configuring academicpages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
