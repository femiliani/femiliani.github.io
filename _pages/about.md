Hello! Welcome to the early beginnings of this website. I'm from Milan, Italy, grew up in Dubai, UAE, ended up in Baltimore for college, and now I'm in New Hampshire! I'm currently an MD-PhD student at Dartmouth pursuing my PhD in the lab of Dr. Aaron McKenna. Broadly my research interests lie in developing new molecular and computational tools for research and diagnostics. I have gotten more involved with long-read sequencing lately and can't help but notice the potential it has for rapid and affordable diagnostics. What seemed like a sci-fi dream of putting in a sample and getting a near instant result is slowly becoming reality and I aim to be part of that. 

Lessons in MolBio
======
I was fortunate to learn cloning techniques from some excellent teachers. They laid the foundation which I then honed by creating (unnecessarily) complex plasmids. What I've learned is that cloning is actually easy once you know the rules that are written between the lines of protocols. In the [Lessons in MolBio](https://femiliani.github.io/year-archive/) I will try to share the tips/tricks/rules I learnt with you so that you will come to love cloning too. 

Hobbies 
======
Sometimes we have to do things other than science to stay sane. If you want to see some cool drone photography of the upper valley, learn how to make jewelry with lost-wax casting, try out some of my favorite recipes (including my grandmother's apple cake), or try to grow hot peppers in a climate that's definitely not suited for them [check out this section](https://femiliani.github.io/hobbies/).

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons. 

Example: editing a markdown file for a talk
